### API Information

The Crypto_Track application retrieves data from the CoinGecko API. The API provides comprehensive cryptocurrency market data, including prices, market capitalization, volume, and more. For more information about the API and available endpoints, visit [https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation).

Please note that the availability and usage limits of the CoinGecko API are subject to the API provider's terms and conditions.

**Note:** If you encounter the issue of always showing "no results found" by default, it might be due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. Please ensure that your browser allows cross-origin requests to the API. You may need to configure CORS settings on the server-side or use a proxy server to bypass the CORS issue.
